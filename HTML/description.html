        <h3>Childhood Early life</h3>
        
        <p>odak Black was born Dieuson Octave, on June 11, 1997, in Pompano Beach, Florida, to Haitian immigrant parents. His father abandoned the family soon after Kodak was born, and he was raised by a single mother. Soon after his father left, Kodak and his mother shifted to a nearby housing society in Golden Acres where many immigrants from Haiti also lived.
            The locality was not ideal by any standards, and Octave eventually got involved with the anti-social elements of the area. He started selling drugs and indulging in other petty crimes at a tender age.
            He was not interested in academics and had a poor attendance record. Additionally, he got into several fights in school, which led to his expulsion from the school on many occasions.
            He did not care about school and wanted to become a rapper. He read several books to get a strong hold on the English language. By the time he was 12 years old, he had already started rapping. Recollecting his struggling days, Octave later stated that he had only two options: to sell drugs on gunpoint or to rap.
            He started visiting more recording studios and found them to be places he actually enjoyed. However, he did not stop his criminal ways and continued to get arrested from time and time. He was arrested at the age of 15 over a serious charge.
            It appeared as if all his aspirations of becoming a rapper would be over soon, but one of his producers bailed him out. He knew that the boy had some talent in him and that he could be a great asset to him. This was the turning point in Octave’s career.</p>
